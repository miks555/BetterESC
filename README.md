### BetterESC

**BetterESC** is a utility designed to ensure that the **Left Alt + Home** key combination mimics the behavior of the **ESC** key in fullscreen applications and games. Many games or full-screen programs intercept and block the ESC key, which can be frustrating when you need to exit or perform an action. With BetterESC, pressing **Left Alt + Home** will trigger the same behavior as pressing ESC, allowing you to exit full-screen modes in most cases where ESC is normally blocked.
